# lazy-code-skill

Cursor skills and rules for efficient coding, pre-commit docs sync, new-project scaffolding, dual-remote push, debugging, and TDD. Install at **project level** so any project can use them.

## Installation for Cursor

Install these skills and rules into your project so Cursor discovers them. In **Cursor Agent chat**, paste and send:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bakwankawa/lazy-code-skill/refs/heads/main/.cursor/INSTALL.md
```

The agent will clone this repo into your project’s `.cursor/` and copy the skills and rules. If your repo’s default branch is not `main`, use that branch in the URL (e.g. `refs/heads/master`).

**Direct link to install instructions:** [.cursor/INSTALL.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bakwankawa/lazy-code-skill/refs/heads/main/.cursor/INSTALL.md)

## What’s included
