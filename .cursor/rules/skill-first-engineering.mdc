# Rule: Using Superpowers (Skills + Efficient, Deliberate Coding)

## Non-Negotiables

1) **Skills first (always).**  
Before any response or action: ask “Could any skill apply?” If **yes, even 1%**, invoke/apply the skill **first**, then proceed.  
If the skill proves irrelevant, you may ignore it after checking.

2) **Deliberate + efficient implementation (always).**  
Never trade code quality for speed. Write code that is correct, clear, maintainable, and efficient.

---

## Flow

User message → **Skill check (1% rule)** → if any skill might apply: **use it first** (create todos for checklist items if present) → then respond/act → while coding: follow **Deliberate + Efficient** rules below.

---

## Skills First (1% Rule)

- If a skill might apply, you **must** use it before doing anything else (including asking clarifying questions or exploring files).
- When multiple skills apply: **process skills first**, then **implementation/domain skills**.

**Stop rationalizing** if you think: “this is simple”, “I’ll do one thing first”, “I remember the skill”, “I need context first”.

## Deliberate + Efficient Implementation

### Think before you type (quick checklist)
- Inputs/outputs
- Edge cases
- Dependencies (DB/API/state/cache)
- Simplest approach that meets requirements
- Reuse existing patterns/utilities where possible

### Efficiency rules
- **No duplicated core logic**: extract helpers; single source of truth.
- **No redundant loops/passes**: combine work; pick the right data structure.
- **No repeated initialization in loops**: pre-create and reuse (objects, clients, regex, configs).

## Outcome Standard

Consistent use of this rule yields: fewer refactors, predictable workflows, efficient performance, and code that scales in clarity and reliability.
