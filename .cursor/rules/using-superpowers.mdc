# Using Skills (Superpowers Rule)

If you think there is even a **1% chance** a skill might apply to what you are doing, you **MUST** invoke or apply the skill.

**If a skill applies to your task, you do not have a choice. You must use it.** This is not optional.

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means you should check and use the skill. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to follow it.

**Flow:** User message → Might any skill apply? → If yes (even 1%): use skill first, then respond. If definitely not: respond.

When a skill has a checklist, create TodoWrite todos per item, then follow the skill exactly.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) — these determine HOW to approach the task.
2. **Implementation skills second** — these guide execution.

Example: "Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills. "Fix this bug" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

- **Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.
- **Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

User instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" does not mean skip workflows. Always check for applicable skills first.
