# Efficient & High-Quality Coding

This skill ensures that any generated or reviewed code is **both efficient and high-quality**.  
Performance improvements must **never** reduce readability, correctness, maintainability, or safety.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Quality first, performance always**
   - Never trade correctness, clarity, or maintainability for raw speed.
   - Optimizations must be explainable and justified.

2. **No unnecessary work**
   - Do not initialize objects, clients, configs, or connections repeatedly.
   - Avoid loops, computations, or allocations that do not change the outcome.

3. **Predictable resource usage**
   - Avoid excessive memory allocation.
   - Prefer streaming, iterators, generators, or batching when appropriate.
   - Reuse objects safely when lifecycle allows.

4. **Measure before optimizing**
   - Optimize only when there is a clear cost (time, memory, CPU, I/O).
   - If performance impact is unclear, favor clarity.

## Mandatory Coding Rules

### Initialization
- Initialize expensive resources **once**, not inside loops or hot paths.
- Cache immutable or reusable objects.
- Lazy-initialize only when it meaningfully reduces cost.

✅ Good:
```python
client = DatabaseClient()

for item in items:
    client.process(item)
```

❌ Bad:
```python
for item in items:
    client = DatabaseClient()
    client.process(item)
```

---

### Looping & Control Flow
- Avoid nested loops when a single pass is sufficient.
- Do not loop if a vectorized, batched, or built-in operation exists.
- Exit early when conditions are met.

✅ Good:
```python
for x in data:
    if x == target:
        return True
return False
```

❌ Bad:
```python
found = False
for i in range(len(data)):
    for j in range(1):
        if data[i] == target:
            found = True
```

---

### Memory Usage
- Avoid building large temporary lists when streaming is enough.
- Prefer generators / iterators for large data.
- Do not copy data structures unless required.

✅ Good:
```python
total = sum(x.value for x in records)
```

❌ Bad:
```python
values = [x.value for x in records]
total = sum(values)
```

---

### Data Structures
- Choose data structures based on access patterns.
  - Lookup → `dict` / `set`
  - Order matters → `list`
  - Frequent membership checks → `set`
- Never use a slower structure for convenience.

---

### I/O and External Calls
- Batch external calls when possible.
- Never call network / disk / DB operations inside tight loops unless unavoidable.
- Clearly separate compute logic from I/O logic.

---

## Optimization Boundaries

Only optimize when **all** conditions are met:
- The code is correct.
- The code is readable.
- The bottleneck is identified or obvious.
- The optimization does not reduce maintainability.

If forced to choose:
> **Readable + correct + fast enough** beats **clever + fast + fragile**.

## Review Checklist (Always Apply)

Before finalizing code, verify:

- [ ] No repeated initialization in loops
- [ ] No unnecessary loops or nested loops
- [ ] Memory usage is proportional to problem size
- [ ] Data structures are appropriate
- [ ] No premature or speculative optimizations
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] Performance improvements are justified

---

## Output Expectations

When generating or reviewing code:

- Prefer clear structure over clever tricks.
- Add brief comments only where performance decisions are non-obvious.
- If optimization is applied, ensure it is safe and explainable.

This skill must be applied automatically whenever writing, refactoring, or reviewing code.
